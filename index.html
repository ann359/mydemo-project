		<p> I am living in Helsinki for 5 months so it is easy for me to go there number of times but as a tourist don't forget to visit this place as it has it's own history. If you want to know more about this church then keep reading my website. Here, I will provide you a piece of information with my live experience. The Cathedral, by Carl Ludvig Engel, rising on the northern side of the Senate Square is the stage of national and academic festive services and one of the most popular tourist sights. The church is part of Helsinki's Empire era centre and a landmark for those arriving by sea. It has become the symbol of the whole of Helsinki. Earlier called St. Nicholas Church and Great Cathedral, the current main <span style="color:red">church of the Helsinki Diocese</span> was completed in 1852. Sculptures of the twelve apostles guard the city from the roof of the church.</p>
